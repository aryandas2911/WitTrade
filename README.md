## 🚀 Problem We’re Solving
- ❌ Startups spend time and resources onboarding interns who lack relevant skills.  
- ❌ Learners rely on generic YouTube/Udemy courses that don’t match real-world startup needs.  
- ❌ No transparent, scalable system exists that connects startups with learners for **practical, niche upskilling**.

- Startups design **short, project-based sessions** aligned to their unique requirements.  
- Learners **choose, learn, and prove themselves** by completing modules and projects.  
- Every learner’s growth is tracked in a **Skill Wallet** (verifiable performance history) (not implemented).  
- Hiring decisions are based on **actual performance**, not just resumes.
